TORONTO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--In an almost unthinkable display of conflict-of-interest, a former Air Canada legal counsel, Maryse Tremblay, will rule on whether to end job action by striking Air Canada flight attendants at the Canada Industrial Relations Board.

"FRA: The Time Has Passed For This Floating Rate Income Fund. FRA offers high income via floating rate debt, but its golden era may be ending as interest rate cuts loom.

"S&P Global: High Valuation And High Expectations Make Market-Beating Returns Unlikely. S&P Global is a high-quality, consistent compounder, with 6%-8% long-term growth and improving margins, but recent returns have lagged, due to lofty valuations. Q2 results beat expectations, with 6% revenue and 10% EPS growth, but growth remains modest and guidance upgrades set a high bar for H2. Current valuation at 32x forward earnings (3x PEG) is difficult to justify without acceleration in growth or margins, limiting upside potential.",negative,générale,CA:WHEAT;LU:FINANCIAL_SERVICES
