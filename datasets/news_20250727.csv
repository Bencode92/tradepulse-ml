"BTC digital asset field continues to exert its strength, HASHJ launches Bitcoin cloud mining platform with ""capital + technology"" dual-driven mode. [UK, July 24, 2025] - BTC As the blockchain industry enters a new round of market cycle, the multi-currency linkage effect gradually emerges, and the price of BTC today starts to rise at 118875.30. According to foreign media reports such as Investing, with the continuous inflow of US spot ETF funds, the acceleration of technology implementation by the Ethereum Layer 2 Industry Alliance, and the launch of the network upgrade of Dogecoin (DOGE), Bitcoin's ""safe-haven attribute"" as a market value anchor has once again attracted capital favor, and its network computing power and BTC mining income have increased significantly. Another major positive news this week also boosted BTC confidence: MEI Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: MEIP) announced that Litecoin (LTC) will be included in the corporate treasury portfolio and completed the allocation of digital assets worth $100 million, which has aroused the capital market's deep attention to the reserve allocation model of encrypted assets. This behavior not only verifies the trust of mainstream institutions in encrypted assets, but also indirectly drives the prices of major currencies including Bitcoin to rise simultaneously. Hashj made timely adjustments to the market and provided new members with a maximum registration reward of $118 for BTC mining experience.",positive,générale,"NL:COCOA,US:SOYBEAN,CN:RUBBER"
