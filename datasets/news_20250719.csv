Both McDonald's and Restaurant Brands International are high-quality, long-term 'buy and hold' stocks with distinct risk-return profiles. My 'Flipping Burger' strategy capitalizes on valuation deviations between MCD and QSR, switching positions as relative value shifts. The strategy has been successful to date, as QSR has outperformed. QSR currently offers better forward value due to higher earnings growth estimates, successful brand turnarounds, and favorable international trends.
