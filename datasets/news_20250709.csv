Don&#8217;t waste another minute; get started by clicking here.(Sponsor) India and China have long competed for dominance on the Asian continent, but their standoff along the disputed Himalayan border has reignited tensions between two of the continent’s largest military powers. In recent years, these tensions have boiled over into outright conflict. However, both nations are now seeking a permanent solution for the border going forward. With millions of active personnel between them, both nations boast formidable armies backed by growing defense budgets and advanced aircraft. Again, each is hoping for a peaceful solution for this border and that two of the largest forces in the world will not have to clash again. Here, 24/7 Wall St. is taking a closer look at powers in Asia and which of these countries have the largest militaries. To determine the Asian countries with the largest total military forces, 24/7 Wall St. reviewed the 2025 Military Strength Ranking from Global Firepower, an annually updated defense-related statistics website with information on 145 countries.

The smaller the PowerIndex value the more powerful a nation’s theoretical conventional fighting capability is. We ranked these countries according to their total military personnel. We included supplemental information regarding active military personnel, military aircraft, and vehicles, as well as the overall military strength score and defense budget.

"Are Precious Metals A Good Investment For An Economic Collapse?. In the world of discovering good investments, there is a prevailing belief that entering the stock market is the right approach. Of course, the hope is that the market rises, as does your portfolio, leaving you with ample funds to live on and retire comfortably. Key Points This Redditor is concerned about what would happen in the event of an apocalyptic scenario. Asking whether buying physical silver would be the right idea, Reddit responds in an almost unanimous way. There is no reason to believe that buying silver will be helpful in the event of a catastrophic global event. Are you ahead, or behind on retirement? SmartAsset’s free tool can match you with a financial advisor in minutes to help you answer that today. Each advisor has been carefully vetted, and must act in your best interests. Don’t waste another minute; get started by clicking here.(Sponsor) Unfortunately, the stock market is only good during times when economic certainty is strong, but what about during uncertain times? One Redditor posting in r/preppers is wondering what would happen in the event of an economic collapse. More specifically, they are wondering if they need to invest more in precious metals. The Big Question For this Redditor, who had recently discussed the possibility of a global economic disaster with someone, a point was raised that is worth considering. Instead of solely investing in the market and other areas, such as real estate, they were advised to consider purchasing physical silver. According to the Redditor, the person they spoke with is not an unsavvy investor and is “very knowledgeable about the topic.” Of course, this immediately led to several questions about how silver would compare to traditional investment ideas, such as high-yield savings, IRAs, and 401(k) s. The Redditor is asking their fellow preppers if they agree with the person they initially talked with. The good news is that the Redditor was naturally skeptical and didn’t just take this information as gospel. Instead, they are wondering how someone in Venezuela would benefit from owning a physical metal. Investing Versus Owning Precious Metals When it comes to &#8220;owning&#8221; precious metals, there are generally different options you can consider from an investment standpoint. The first option is to invest in precious metals through the market, where you can take advantage of the rising and falling prices of gold, silver, and other metals based on market conditions. For the most part, investors would say that during market downturns, these commodities tend to hold up better than, say, shares of Apple or Microsoft. On the other hand, you have the second option of physically owning precious metals, which would take up space in your home, safe, or safety deposit box. This is what the Redditor is discussing: if the worst-case scenario happened, like all of the power went out all over the world, would owning silver be something of value that would help you survive when cash is no longer king? To be honest, if you are someone who is expecting the world to collapse, as many people in r/preppers often think about, the only investments you should make are in food and supplies. There is unlikely to be significant value in anything other than what people directly need to survive. What Reddit Thinks It’s not often an entire Reddit section agrees on any topic at all, but in the case of this post, there is pretty much universal agreement. Many of the comments highlight the reality that, in the event of a societal collapse, giving someone a chunk of silver or metal for supplies is likely to be ignored. One Redditor sums it up best when they ask the original poster to ask themselves, &#8216;If society completely collapses and people are starving in the streets, will a shiny piece of metal be of any value?&#8217; There is a good amount of conversation that highlights that the better investment is in land, learning new skills, and understanding how to survive in the immediate aftermath of any kind of event. In other words, if the question is whether precious metals are a good investment if society collapses, the answer is no. They may be a good investment while society is intact, but the idea that pieces of silver will have true value post-apocalypse is more fantasy than fact The post Are Precious Metals A Good Investment For An Economic Collapse? appeared first on 24/7 Wall St..",positive,critique
"What Income Level is Considered Middle Class in Your State?. Critics are calling the GOP’s recent tax bill the “reverse Robin Hood”, as it benefits millionaires, while harming working and middle class Americans. Under the new House bill, social programs are cut, while tax breaks are offered to the wealthy. Though the bill promises modest relief for middle-class citizens, providing an average of $815 in tax cuts for those earning between $51k and $92k, it overwhelmingly favors the wealthy. The top 1% of wealthy Americans stand to gain over $44k in tax cuts, with the highly exclusive top 0.1% benefitting even more. Other ‘favors’ to the middle and working classes include deductions on tipped income and overtime. However, these benefits are offset by gutting both SNAP and Medicaid funding. For much of the last decade in the United States, the rich have been getting richer, and the poor have been getting poorer. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the share of income controlled by the wealthiest 5% of households climbed from 23.3% in 2015 to 23.6% in 2022. Meanwhile, the share of income controlled by the poorest 20% of households fell from 3.2% to 3.0% over the same period. This recent trend &#8212; and the growing number of Americans at the extreme ends of the income spectrum &#8212; is closely connected to the long-term hollowing out of the middle class. A 2022 study from the Pew Research Center found that the share of American adults in the middle-income tier fell from 61% in 1971 to just 50% in 2021. The declining ranks of middle-income Americans has been precipitated by a number of factors, including globalization and technological advancements. In recent decades, many well-paying factory and white-collar jobs have shifted to lower-cost markets overseas or been taken over by computers and automation. While the decline of the American middle-class has been well documented, exactly what it means to be middle-class is not so straightforward. In relative terms, the middle class lies between the working class and the upper class on the socioeconomic spectrum. Typically, middle class households have some disposable income for luxuries like vacations and eating at restaurants and are able to put money away for savings and retirement. Still, these same households generally rely on loans for big-ticket items, such as a house, car, or college education. These indicators of middle class status are not hard and fast rules, however, and lose their utility when analyzing large populations. While perhaps less nuanced and comprehensive, household income offers a more quantifiable gauge of middle-class status. Using data from the U.S. Census Bureau&#8217;s 2022 American Community Survey, 24/7 Wall St. identified the income it takes to be considered middle class in every state. Middle-income ranges were calculated using a version of the Pew Research Center&#8217;s methodology. In each state, the income threshold for middle-class is anywhere between two-thirds and double the state&#8217;s median household income. All supplemental data in the story is from the ACS and the Bureau of Economic Analysis. The estimated minimum household income necessary to be in the middle class ranges from about $35,000 to just over $64,000, depending on the state. Meanwhile, the upper-limit of middle class incomes varies by state from about $105,400 to nearly $193,000. Across the U.S. as a whole, a middle class household can earn anywhere from $49,837 to $149,510. (Here is a look at the salary it takes to be rich in each state.) While there are some exceptions, states with higher income thresholds also tend to have a higher overall cost of living. Conversely, the cost of living in a given state with a lower-income middle class tends to be below average. (Here is a look at the most expensive states to live in.) It is important to note that this ranking does not account for household size &#8212; and that many members of the middle class, more broadly defined, may have incomes that fall outside of the ranges presented on this list. Still, most households with incomes that fall within these upper and lower thresholds comprise the core of each state&#8217;s middle class. This post was updated on July 8, 2025 to include details of the newly passed GOP House bill. Why It Matters The middle class has long been the economic backbone of the United States. In addition to being a pillar of stability, a strong middle class is also a key driver of economic growth. Middle class households offer a reliable market for goods and services, their labor is an engine of entrepreneurship and innovation, and their tax dollars help sustain investment in quality public services. Exactly what income level is enough to afford a middle-class lifestyle varies across the country, however, and in some states, the middle class is far wealthier than in others.

"Baby Boomers Rank Their 10 Least Favorite Classic Rock Artists. Pearl Jam has been a beloved rock band since its inception in 1998, with a massive following across America and beyond. On July 7, Matt Cameron, the band’s drummer with near-legendary status, announced he will leave the popular rock group. His departure will end a 27-year-long run with Pearl Jam. Following the unexpected announcement, the 62-year-old drummer expressed his gratitude on social media. Alongside other band members, Cameron reflected on infamous performances and memories in the studio. No successor has been named. Rock is certainly the genre of older generations. Those 65 and older grew up in the 60s and 70s, rebelling against their parent&#8217;s conventional music. Ultimately musical tastes are subjective. However, Boomers tend to agree that the music of their generation far exceeds the &#8220;noise&#8221; that current youth is so fond of. Using information from a wide range of social media sites, 24/7 Wall St. determines Boomers 10 least beloved classic rock musicians. We researched sites like YouGov and Reddit, along with several other survey sites. This post was updated on July 8, 2025 to include Matt Cameron&#8217;s announcement that he is leaving Pearl Jam. Why We Are Talking About This The emergence of classic rock shook the American landscape. Artists like Elvis Presley and the Beatles introduced sex and rock and roll to America&#8217;s youth in ways never seen in previous generations. Boomers were front and center when this once-controversial music was originally released. Who better to rank the least favorite classic rock artists than Baby Boomers themselves? See if you agree with their picks. 10. Brian Wilson Years active: 1961 &#8211; Net worth: $100 million Known for: Lead singer and principal songwriter for the Beach Boys Beach Bummer Though Dick Dale is credited with the invention of surf rock, Brian Wilson took the genre to another level altogether, shaping the sound that would become synonymous with the Southern California beach scene. However, by the time end-stage boomers were in high school, Wilson&#8217;s band, The Beach Boys had been regulated to golden oldie AM radio. It was the 1970s and Wilson was in the throes of his mental health crisis. Skynard and Floyd were the new cool; the Beach Boys were out. However, many still adored the Beach Boys and played them to the exclusion of any other artists. Their music is simple, upbeat fun: the perfect soundtrack to a summer romance. 9. Robert Palmer Years active: 1964-2003 Net worth: $10 million (2003) Known for: Addicted to Love/ Lead singer for The Power Station Low Energy, Low Rizz Who doesn&#8217;t like to bounce to Robert Palmer&#8217;s Addicted to Love? And Sneakin&#8217; Sally Thru the Alley? That album rocked, even if Rolling Stone only gave it 3 stars. So, why isn&#8217;t Robert Palmer more popular with the Boomer set? Referring to him as &#8220;low-energy Mick Jagger&#8221; or &#8220;Mr. Fancy Pants&#8221;, Boomers say they dislike the artist more than his music. Palmer simply didn&#8217;t have enough rizz to break on through to the other side&#8230; 8. Lenny Kravitz Years active: 1981- Net worth: $80 million Known for: Songwriter/Media advertising Fly Away Lenny Kravitz is a talented musician. However, Kravitz&#8217;s fusion of rock, funk, and soul doesn’t appeal to the majority of Baby Boomers. Beyond the music, Boomers have a lot to say about Kravitz’s personality, describing him as flamboyant and ostentatious. Others view him as a sell-out, due to his campaigns for Stella Artois and YSL. Who knew Boomers were such a tough crowd? 7. Glenn Frey Years active: 1966-2015 Net worth: $120 million (2016) Known for: Guitar/keys/vocals for The Eagles The Heat Was On Coming in at number 7 on our list of the 10 least popular classic rock artists is Glenn Frey. Loads of Boomers blame Frey for the demise of The Eagles. Though he was certainly a party to their disbandment, it takes two to tangle. Regardless, it&#8217;s difficult to shake that image. Just ask Yoko. 6. Elvis Costello Years active: 1970- Net worth: $70 million Known for: Songwriter/ documentary maker Punch The Clock Costello&#8217;s music blends elements of punk, new wave, and rock with intricate wordplay and socially conscious lyrics to splendid results. But according to some Boomers, his music is jangly, and he ripped off Buddy Holly&#8217;s trademark style. 5. Jeff Beck Years active: 1964-2023 Net worth: $25 million Known for: Yardbirds/solo work Yardbird While the critics adored Jeff Beck, consumers were less effusive. Characterized by his innovative approach to guitar and his willingness to experiment with pushing musical boundaries beyond their formerly adhered-to limits, Jeff Beck was simply a bit too avant-garde for many Boomers, especially those who had been fans of his original, more-conventional group, the Yardbirds. 4. Michael Bolton Years active: 1975- Net worth: $80 million Known for: singer/songwriter/collaborator/ television personality Easy Now Number 4 on the list is Michael Bolton. A child musical prodigy, Bolton parlayed his music career into an equally lucrative career in television. So, why don&#8217;t Baby Boomers think more of him? Placing him in the classic rock category is a bit of a stretch. The Boomers I queried feel Bolton&#8217;s music should be classified as easy listening/jazz. 3. Gene Simmons Years active: 1970- Net worth: $400 million Known for: bassist for KISS/ television personality Kiss From their iconic makeup and catchy hard rock tunes to their theatrical pyrotechnics, KISS earned their status as one of the most recognizable and influential hard rock bands of the 20th century. But the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. Gene Simmons without KISS just isn&#8217;t as popular as Gene Simmons with KISS. 2. Axl Rose Years active: 1983- Net worth: $200 million Known for: Guns and Roses Axl Rose, the lead singer and primary songwriter of Guns N&#8217; Roses, is a polarizing artist. Every rose has its thorn, and Axl is no exception. From erratic, sometimes violent behavior, to spending 15 years on a less-than-stellar album (Chinese Democracy), Axl Rose never recovered the momentum of Appetite for Destruction, GNR&#8217;s breakthrough album. 1. Frank Zappa Years active: 1955-1993 Net worth: $1 million (1993) Known for: Satirical lyrics and strong opinions Zapped Coming in at number one on 24/7 Wall St.&#8217;s list is none other than Frank Zappa. The appeal of Frank Zappa varies wildly among Baby Boomers. His music is unconventional and challenging to the unaccustomed ear. Zappa&#8217;s sharp wit and fearless approach to tackling societal and political issues through his controversial, often satirical lyrics, coupled with his critique of mainstream culture, simply did not resonate with the majority of Boomers. However, for these very same reasons, Gen Z has discovered Zappa and they are digging his message.
