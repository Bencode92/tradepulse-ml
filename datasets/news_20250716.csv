Since their inception in the 1st Ranger Battalion in 1942, this group has taken on high-risk missions from airborne raids to direct combat. The gear that these troops rely on reflects the necessity for reliability, adaptability, and ultimately firepower for whatever operational needs may be. Here, 24/7 Wall St. is taking a closer look at the small arms used by the US Army Rangers. To determine the guns used by the US Army Rangers, 24/7 Wall St. reviewed guns cataloged by Military Factory, an online database of military vehicles, aircraft, and arms. Out of this catalog of guns, we removed similar guns and guns that are believed to no longer be in use. We ranked the guns according to when they entered service. We included supplemental data on the type of weapon, maximum effective range, and the caliber or ammunition used by each gun. Here is a look at the guns used by the US Army Rangers: Why Are We Covering This? Understanding the weapons and small arms used by todayâs militaries gives some insight into a nationâs combat capabilities, or even tactical doctrines. These guns are not just instruments of warfare, but they actually reflect the technological innovation and defense budgets for a given military over the time. By exploring which rifles, sidearms, machine guns, and support weapons are fielded by various armed forces, we can better understand how nations prepare for conflict, defend their interests, and ultimately shape their battlefield effectiveness.

"Should I Use My Inheritance to Help My husbandâs Struggling Family?. Receiving a large chunk of unexpected money is certainly worthy of gratitude; however, in addition to opportunity, this fortunate turn of events can create conflict. A female Reddit poster recently exemplified such a scenario when she posted about her rising family tensions. She had inherited funds, which her husband wanted to give to his financially struggling parents. The Redditor questioned whether she should share the cash with her in-laws even though she didnât want to. Sharing with family members can feel good in the moment, but it is not the best action to take if it might jeopardize your own financial future. This difficult question highlights the importance of priorities and boundaries surrounding finances. Each year, Americans are faced with rising costs of living, and many feel pressure to support extended family. But when it comes to the best self-protection strategy, financial advisors advocate for personal security before generosity. However, not everyone agrees with this perspective and different views within one family can lead to plenty of conflict, particularly for couples who share bank accounts. This slideshow explores the potential of sharing unexpected windfalls with family members, covering the financial implications and the personal dynamics involved. We walk you step-by-step through emotional tension, legal concerns, and practical tips. If you have come face to face with this same scenario, or worry about poor boundaries within the family unit, take a look at these slides for some straightforward advice. When Inheritance Sparks Conflict A Reddit user shared their experience about inheriting money and being pressured to share it with in-laws. The user&#8217;s husband wanted to use her inheritance to help his struggling parents, despite her objections. The Importance of Financial Boundaries Financial independence requires setting clear boundaries, especially with shared household income. Couples often need to agree on how windfalls are treated to avoid resentment or misunderstandings. Why Helping In-Laws Isn&#8217;t an Obligation Legally and financially, you&#8217;re not responsible for your in-laws unless you&#8217;ve made specific commitments. Supporting them should be voluntary and never come at the cost of your own financial health. Consider Separate Finances Had the Reddit user and her husband kept separate finances, the conflict might have been avoided. For those whose financial perspectives do not align, maintaining separate accounts might be the answer. Communication is Key Couples must communicate openly and respectfully about money, especially large sums. Disagreements over financial priorities can erode trust if not addressed early and honestly. Generosity Should Not Involve Guilt The pressure to help family can lead to guilt and resentment if one partner feels forced into giving. Generosity should stem from a shared decision, not a sense of obligation, guilt, or manipulation. What Financial Advisors Say Advisors stress securing your own future before giving large sums to others. A sudden windfall should ideally strengthen your retirement. Protecting Assets Clear communication and boundaries help maintain relationships and financial health. Allowing money to create conflict within a relationship can lead to irreversible damage. Navigating Shared Finances and Big Decisions Couples should revisit shared financial goals after windfalls or major life changes. Reaffirming goals can help determine whether and how to help extended family. Protect Your Peace Inheritance is personal and should reflect the giver&#8217;s intent and the receiverâs needs. Set boundaries, communicate with care, and never feel guilty for securing your own future first.

"Want Growth but Worry About Too Much Tech? Then Load Up on This Top Vanguard ETF. Key Points in This Article: Vanguard Mega Cap Growth ETFâs (MGK) consumer discretionary segment diversifies beyond tech, capturing innovative companies driving growth in evolving consumer trends. MGK offers access to consumer-focused businesses, underrepresented in broader market ETFs, enhancing portfolio growth potential. Nvidia made early investors rich, but there is a new class of âNext Nvidia Stocksâ that could be even better. Click here to learn more. The stock market&#8217;s plunge in April was brought on by fear, even panic, of being caught in a downward spiral. Savvy investors, however, knew to hang tight and ensure they had some powder dry to capitalize on the opportunity. The rewards were substantial as the major indexes recently hit new record highs. However, what seasoned investors understand is that the most significant wealth-building gains come not from short-term market timing but rather from holding high-quality assets over the long term, allowing compounding to work its magic. Even with markets at new peaks, there are still compelling opportunities in growth-oriented investments, particularly in the technology-heavy Vanguard Mega Cap Growth ETF (NYSEARCA:MGK). With a low expense ratio of 0.07% or just $7 per $10,000 invested, MGK offers exposure to some of the largest and most dynamic growth companies in the U.S., with a strong tilt toward technology. Hereâs why MGK remains an attractive option for patient investors, along with considerations for whether it suits your portfolio. The Power of Mega-Cap Leaders Only a decade ago, today&#8217;s market leaders like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) were were much smaller and less influential than they are now. In 2015, Microsoft was worth just $358 billion while the artificial intelligence chip stock was primarily a gaming graphics processing unit (GPU) maker worth less than $11 billion. Today, these two companies are the richest stocks on the market. Nvidia is now the most valuable company in the world at nearly $3.9 trillion, while Microsoft is worth about $3.7 trillion. In just the past few years, they are responsible for a significant portion of the S&amp;P 500âs growth. In the Vanguard Mega Cap Growth ETF, this pair represents approximately one-quarter of the portfolio, compared to about 13% in a broad S&amp;P 500 ETF like the Vanguard S&amp;P 500 ETF (NYSEARCA:VOO). For investors seeking amplified exposure to these market leaders, MGK offers a targeted way to capture their growth. However, concentration has its nuances. While Microsoft and Nvidia are trading at all-time highs, other high-growth tech leaders like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) have lagged. The iPhone maker is down roughly 15% year-to-date. Without this underperformance, MGKâs returns could have been even stronger (Apple is its third-largest holding at 11.6% of the portfolio), highlighting the ETFâs sensitivity to its top holdings. Growth Beyond Tech Titans While MGKâs top holdings drive significant returns, the ETFâs consumer discretionary segment, making up over 20% of the portfolio, offers compelling growth opportunities. This sector includes leading companies like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), which are not only household names but also innovators reshaping consumer behavior and industries. These firms contribute to MGKâs appeal by providing exposure to dynamic, high-growth businesses outside the tech-heavy core. Amazon, a cornerstone of the consumer discretionary allocation, continues to dominate e-commerce while expanding into areas like cloud computing (through AWS, though not counted in MGKâs consumer discretionary weighting) and advertising. Its investments in logistics and AI-driven personalization enhance its ability to capture consumer spending, positioning it for sustained growth. Similarly, Teslaâs leadership in electric vehicles and energy solutions taps into shifting consumer preferences toward sustainability and innovation. Both companies exemplify the sectorâs potential to deliver outsized returns, fueled by evolving consumer trends and technological advancements. Beyond these giants, MGK includes other consumer discretionary players like Home Depot (NYSE:HD) and Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX), which are adapting to changing market dynamics. Home Depot benefits from steady demand in home improvement, while Starbucks leverages digital ordering and loyalty programs to maintain growth. These companies, though smaller in weighting, add diversification within the sector, balancing the portfolioâs reliance on mega-cap tech. By investing in MGK, you gain access to these consumer-driven innovators, which are underrepresented in broader market ETFs like Vanguard&#8217;s S&amp;P 500 ETF, where consumer discretionary makes up only about 10% of the index. A Strategic Fit for Long-Term Investors Despite recent market highs, MGK remains a compelling option for those bullish on mega-cap growth, particularly in tech-driven innovation. The ETFâs low cost, diversified exposure to top-tier companies, and alignment with trends like AI make it a strong candidate for long-term portfolios. For investors wary of over-concentration, an alternative approach is to review MGKâs holdings and selectively invest in individual names to avoid duplicating existing positions. Ultimately, MGK is worth a closer look for investors comfortable with its risks and seeking to capitalize on the enduring growth of mega-cap leaders. By holding quality investments like MGK over time, you position yourself to benefit from the compounding power of the marketâs most innovative companies.

"Todayâs Best Vodka Brand and 8 You Should Avoid. Vodka has long been a favorite spirit, enjoyed for its subtle flavor and versatility. In honor of the beloved liquor, the 7th Annual International Bartender Spirits Award for Best Vodka of 2025 has just been named. The title goes to Angry Giraffe Premium Vodka, known for its purity, balance, and smooth character. To determine the annual winner, a team of distinguished bartenders evaluated a series of vodkas in a blind taste test. Afterwards, the spirits were rated on mixability, mouthfeel, and price-to-quality value. While brands like Giraffe are top of the line, other vodkas are bottom of the barrel. Though even the worst out there get the job done, they are far from classy. When it comes to this beloved spirit, there are certain brands you may do well to stay away from. Letâs take a look at the vodka brands to avoid and learn a little about what makes vodka great in the first place! To compile this list, 24/7 Wall Street used resources from a few well-versed drinkers, notably those on liquor-tasting sites like Tasting Table. Additionally, we compared the process and quality of the products (via things like distillation) to determine if the price tag matches the cost. Letâs get started. This post was updated on July 2, 2025 to include the annual Bartender Spirits Award winner for best vodka. 8. Burnettâs Vodka There is a reputation around Burnett&#8217;s Vodka that it is low quality and doesn&#8217;t taste all that great. Burnettâs has a bit of a reputation among colleges. First, if you are ever running low on gas, drop a handle in your Civic and hear it purr. Second, it has so much bite it might as well have teeth. Itâs often referred to as âpaint thinnerâ or âsanitizer,â but for good reason; itâs usually less than $12 in the United States. Burnett&#8217;s is Best for Cleaning Heavy Machinery Look, we understand the use-case for a product like this (cleaning your lawn mower blades, disinfecting a wound, etc.), but if you are looking for a quality product, this isnât it. There are multiple flavor options, making Burnett&#8217;s a viable mixer for someone looking to make a LOT of cheap drinks, but for only a few dollars more, there are plenty of options that are better suited for consumption. 7. Ciroc CÃ®roc is a luxury brand that upcharges due to its marketing, not necessarily its quality. Ciroc is a bit of a tricky one but has ended up on this list nonetheless. It really had its heyday around 10 years ago when it was the go-to club drink, and every commercial featured a glistening bottle between two babes, but times have changed. Still, to this day, itâs generally regarded as a more luxury vodka option, but most of that price tag comes from its marketing. Combs helped to solidify the brand as an icon, however, and it really isnât bad; itâs just a little overrated for what it is. Ciroc is Made with Grapes and Limited Drink Options The differentiating factor with Ciroc is that itâs made with grapes instead of potatoes or grain, giving it a sweeter taste than many others. Although not necessarily a con, this does limit it as a mixer and change the sorts of drinks that you would ideally use it for as a vodka. 6. Karkov Karkov is similar to Burnett&#8217;s in that they are cheap, usually college-centric liquors. Karkov is another college-fueled specialty similar to Burnettâs. While Ciroc may be a decent vodka inflated by marketing, Karkov doesnât shy away from what it is: cheap and available from âthat one store where he doesnât ID you.â The name is a bit sneaky, as one might think that Karkov is actually Russian, but it isnât. Karkov is from a distillery in Minnesota, which helps keep its price so low. Karkov Tastes Like Jet Fuel Again, similar to Burnettâs, the fuel-taste isnât our favorite, and if you are going to spend $11 on bad vodka, you might as well spend $15 on decent Vodka. Also, itâs apparently nick-named âKarcrash,â so yeah. 5. Grey Goose Grey Goose is a decent vodka, but they upcharge for what the product actually is. We would place Grey Goose along with Ciroc, mainly in the regard that itâs a well-marketed product that derives its high price from its name and not necessarily its product. To be clear, Grey Goose isnât a bad vodka, but itâs usually the first âluxuryâ vodka that someone tries and thinks, âWow, there actually is a difference when you spend a little more.â That being said, the difference with Grey Goose is price-in a little much. Grey Goose is Overpriced Grey Goose is only distilled once, something that most other brands do 2-4 times before letting it hit shelves. Additionally, it was created with the intention of differentiating itself in the market due to its price and marketed as being made in France (because France is known for luxury products). It worked. Itâs a totally fine liquor, but if you are going to spend nearly $50 for a bottle, you can do a lot better. 4. Skyy Skyy is a step up from the lowest-level vodkas, but it isn&#8217;t known to be great quality, by any means. Skyy is a weird vodka. It isnât as low budget as Karkov or Burnettâs but seeing blue bottles on the kitchen island at a party while you try and convince yourself that âno, I&#8217;m totally fine right nowâ is a formative experience. Itâs the classy cousin that sometimes shows up to parties, but they wore something a little garish, and as youâve matured, you donât want to be associated with them anymore. Skyy is Undrinkable at Room-temp Skyy is produced in California in the United States. It uses grain as its main ingredient, something pretty common across vodka brands. That being said, Skyy is known to have a bad taste when it hits room temperature and is only palatable when chilled. 3. Outskirts Some reviewers of Outskirts claim they can tell that the water supply used isn&#8217;t as pure as it needs to be. Outskirts is a mid-priced vodka brand produced in Texas, but itâs usually only sold in particular stores. As explained by Tasting Table, the process to create the vodka is fine, but the starting point is flawed. Outskirts uses American corn as their primary grain of choice, then it goes through a six-step distillation process. Outskirts Utilizes Bad Water Sounds okay, right? Well, no. Unfortunately, the process was bound to fail because Outskirts uses a not-so-great water supply, and no amount of filtering seems to remove the bad taste. 2. UV Vodka UV Vodka bottles its product in plastic, a tell-tale sign that you are about to ingest an inferior product. Alcoholic beverages may interact with the plasticâs surface, slightly altering the taste or creating a faint âoffâ or synthetic note, particularly when stored for long periods. Additionally, plastic is more permeable to oxygen and light than glass or metal. This can lead to oxidation, which dulls flavor or makes beverages taste stale. UV Comes in Plastic Bottles UV Vodka is our final low-tier vodka on the list that should be avoided primarily because of its price and quality. First, the tip-off that really sets the tone for UV is that it comes in a plastic bottle. Generally speaking, drinking 40% ethanol from a plastic bottle isnât something that anyone should be proud of. Besides the visual implications, there are material differences. Plastic reduces costs, but it has an impact on shelf life and taste since air is able to penetrate plastic much easier. 1. Crystal Head Crystal Head marks up its products drastically, specifically because of misleading advertising surrounding its product. Thereâs a trend appearing in our list. Vodkas you should avoid are either extremely low-quality or are marketed in a way that their price doesnât justify what you get. Crystal Head is maybe the most direct example of this. Crystal Head is Never Worth the Cost The marketing strategy for Crystal Head is quite clear (crystal, even). Make sick packaging that grabs your attention and is cool enough to be a prominent feature of your bar. To that end, mission accomplished. The results of such marketing, however, are unfortunate. Generally, Crystal Head costs around $70 for a 750mL container, marking it as one of the most expensive options at your liquor store. It certainly isnât worth that, despite the marketing terms used to describe it (Herkimer diamond-filtered, pristine Newfoundland water, etc.).

"AI Wave Triggers Tech Layoffs, 100,000 Jobs Are at Risk. Key Points Major tech companies including Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), Meta (NASDAQ: META), and Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) have collectively laid off tens of thousands of employees, increasingly citing AI automation as a driver. AI is replacing lower-level coding roles, enabling significant cost reductions and driving improved margins, particularly for firms with large software development teams. This trend is likely to accelerate as AI capabilities advance, positioning labor efficiency gains as a key profitability lever for mega-cap tech stocks. Are you ahead, or behind on retirement?

[00:00:13] Doug McIntyre: I think Microsoft has announced two and then the, Wall Street Journal said they sort of did a stealth one too. Yep. And they, people are beginning to admit, the chairman of IBM (NYSE: IBM) said this three weeks ago, that AI is now affecting their ability to do coding, particularly what I would describe as lower level coding. [00:00:33] Doug McIntyre: Yep. And who does more coding than a big tech company? I not sure. Nobody. A railroad company or somebody. Yeah. So I&#8217;m looking for lots of layoffs at these companies with AI replacements and to me that&#8217;s a margin play as an investor. Well, yeah. I mean, that are replaceable. That&#8217;s a margin play to me. [00:00:55] Lee Jackson: Well, I have your numbers here. [00:00:57] Lee Jackson: Microsoft, which has been doing extremely good, that laid off 6,500 people. That&#8217;s a fair amount of people. I know they have a, a ton of employees, but Meta Platforms, the stock that has exploded higher over the last two years, they laid off 5% of their workforce, and that&#8217;s 3,600 people. And of course, I know your favorite company that, is a, loss leader in the intel chip business. [00:01:23] Lee Jackson: Intel laid off 21,000 people. And, surveys are indicating, and th this is that there will be over a hundred thousand layoffs just in the tech sector, when it&#8217;s all added up. Just over the last year or [00:01:41] Doug McIntyre: so, listen, the worst run tech company in the universe, IBM, has done some layoffs. They say because of ai Yeah. [00:01:49] Doug McIntyre: And they said there are more coming sell. Yep. When guys who literally, Can&#8217;t find the front door with a, their hands in a flashlight at IBM even. They&#8217;re smart enough to start. I know, So the [00:02:03] Lee Jackson: thing is, I, this is only gonna increase. And like you said,it&#8217;s expensive to get rid of people, but only on a one time basis, and once they&#8217;re out the door and once they&#8217;re severance or whatever&#8217;s been paid, then you know, you&#8217;re home free. [00:02:18] Doug McIntyre: I see this as a big margin play on big tech companies. Yeah. I really do. Being able to replace people, I don&#8217;t know where else it&#8217;s gonna work, but it&#8217;s working in tech [00:02:28] Lee Jackson: Well and exponentially it&#8217;s gonna go higher. &#8217;cause AI&#8217;s gonna get grow more. [00:02:33] Doug McIntyre: Yeah. [00:02:34] Lee Jackson: So if you&#8217;re, an entry-level tech guy, consider a job in welding Yes. [00:02:38] Lee Jackson: To say goodbye. Yeah.I wouldn&#8217;t wanna be some engineer coming out now hoping for a, $200,000 a year job at. Big tech. I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s gonna be there forever.

Billions of dollars are being poured into this endeavor every year. As a result, the US Navy has one of the best shipbuilding pipelines on the planet. It includes advanced destroyers, next-generation aircraft carriers, and cutting-edge attack submarines. These ships and subs will be the newest additions to the strongest Navy in the world. Here, 24/7 Wall St. is taking a closer look at the US Navy and which ships and submarines will be the future of its fleet. (These Naval Ships Have Been Operating for Longer Than Youâve Been Alive.) To determine the future warships and submarines of the U.S. Navy, 24/7 Wall St. reviewed the Upcoming U.S. Navy Commissionings, a military data site. We compiled data on all ships and submarines that have at least had their keel laid and ordered these alphabetically. We included supplemental information regarding the classification of vessel, unit type, and current status. Here is a look at the ships and submarines that will be entering the U.S. Navy in the coming years: Why Are We Covering This? Knowing the most recent ships and submarines to enter the U.S. Navy is important for understanding the state of national security in the United States. Also the Navy is primarily how the United States projects power across vast distances and maintains a secure balance within the global community.

"2 WisdomTree Income ETFs For Retirement Income. Key Points Inflation and loss of buying power is one of the greatest concerns among retirees living on fixed incomes. ETFs combinations that can deliver income, protect against inflation, and show upside appreciation is a win-win package that most investors will welcome. WisdomTreeâs ETF menu can also offer strong dividend income, capital appreciation, and inflation protection via precious metals among its selections. Are you ahead or behind on retirement? Are you intimidated by your lack of investment knowledge when it comes to your portfolio? SmartAssetâs free tool can match you with a financial advisor in minutes to help you answer that today. Each advisor has been carefully vetted and must act in your best interests. Donât waste another minute â get started by clicking here.(Sponsor) According to the Senior Citizens League, loss of buying power is the #1 concern facing retirees in the US, with 92% listing it among their greatest fears in a recent survey. When retirees are living on a fixed income tied to a retirement portfolio, the erosion of buying power through inflation or a market downturn that erodes principal funds can be devastating. Retirees who want to live out their golden years without undue worries about finances will ideally benefit from a portfolio that combines the following elements: Solid income Inflation mitigation Capital appreciation Nailing this investment trifecta ideal on a consistent and foolproof basis is something that has eluded many financial planners, although many have attained at least 2 out of the 3 often enough to build successful practices. Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) are an asset class that track specific market indices and can help to reach that goal on a mix-and-match basis to suit a wide range of investor objectives and risk tolerances. Founded in 1985, New York headquartered WisdomTree Investments has parlayed its ETF product and asset management skills into an 84 ETF strong catalog and $125.4 billion in total global assets under management. While many portfolios will typically track the S&amp;P 500 Index and the Nasdaq 100 for growth, with the S&amp;P 500 High Dividend Index or the 10-year US Treasury bond for yields, there are two (2) WisdomTree selections that are outside the norm that can contribute nicely to a retirement portfolio and to supply one of the missing legs of the trifecta: WisdomTree Emerging Markets High Dividend Fund (NYSE: DEM) WisdomTree Efficient Gold Plus Gold Miners Strategy Fund (CBOE: GDMN) WisdomTree Emerging Markets High Dividend Fund Saudi Arabian Oil Company (better known as ARAMCO) stock is the fifth largest holding in the DEM portfolio. While US GDP growth is expected to grow between 1.7% to 2.7%, according to JP Morgan, other economists anticipate that Emerging Market GDP growth is likely to exceed 4%. The WisdomTree Emerging Markets High Dividend Fund (NYSE: DEM) was created to capitalize on the emerging market opportunities that often are only covered in their respective nations and receive little to any international news coverage. Tracking WisdomTreeâs Emerging Markets High Dividend Index, DEM focuses on the highest dividend yielding stocks among the various emerging market exchanges. Many of the names in its portfolio are familiar, but more oriented in energy, commodities, construction, and finance, as opposed to healthcare, for example.

When it comes to a hedge against inflation, gold has been the go-to hedge by cultures around the world for centuries. Inflation erodes the buying power of currency, which is the scourge of retirees across the nation. A number of economists have attributed recent weakness in the US dollar to several factors: The ascension of the BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa) economic coalition, which has fostered significant international non-dollar trade between member nations; Uncertainty over US tariffs and unresolved trade agreements between the US and nations with yet to be negotiated new trade deals; Concerns over the future of NATO and potential oil supply interruptions due to war in the Middle East. The WisdomTree Efficient Gold Plus Gold Miners Strategy Fund (CBOE: GDMN) is an ETF contemporary market approach to capitalizing on gold exposure for a portfolio. It does this by: Investing directly in a portfolio of US-listed gold futures contracts; Global stocks that derive at least half of their revenues through gold mining operations.

"These Seniors Are Left Out of The Big Beautiful Billâs Big Tax Break. Key Points The Big Beautiful Bill has a nice tax break for older Americans. It also offers relief for older people with large income and property tax bills. As tends to be the case, higher earners may not get to benefit from these new provisions. Are you ahead, or behind on retirement? SmartAssetâs free tool can match you with a financial advisor in minutes to help you answer that today. Each advisor has been carefully vetted, and must act in your best interests. Donât waste another minute; get started by clicking here.(Sponsor) When President Trump was running for office, one of the things he pledged to do was eliminate taxes on Social Security. There are many seniors who don&#8217;t pay taxes on those monthly benefits, but it&#8217;s typical for moderate earners and above to lose a portion of their Social Security checks to federal taxes. And that doesn&#8217;t account for any state taxes that might apply to those benefits. Trump faced pushback from lawmakers in the context of that plan, though. And one reason may have had to do with Social Security&#8217;s precarious financial situation. Social Security is less than a decade away from potential benefit cuts due to an impending revenue shortfall. One source of revenue for Social Security is the taxes seniors pay on their monthly benefits. It&#8217;s not the program&#8217;s main revenue source, but it&#8217;s a big one. And eliminating those taxes could push the program even closer to insolvency. Unfortunately, new legislation that just passed will not let seniors off the hook as far as taxes on Social Security benefits go. But a good number of older Americans may now be in line for a generous tax break. Still, there&#8217;s one group of seniors that&#8217;s apt to get left out in the cold. Higher-income seniors lose out Under the new Big Beautiful Bill, Americans ages 65 and over can claim a bonus tax deduction of $6,000 through 2028. This tax break can be claimed by people who itemize as well as people taking the standard deduction. That&#8217;s good news, but not for everyone. When new tax policies are introduced, it&#8217;s pretty common for them to be income-dependent. In this case, the new deduction for seniors begins to phase out for singles earning over $75,000 and married couples earning more than $150,000. The new tax break phases out completely for singles with incomes over $175,000 and married couples with incomes over $250,000. This means that while many middle class and even upper middle class seniors may get to benefit from the new changes, higher-income seniors are excluded. It also means that while the typical Social Security beneficiary may now be off the hook from paying taxes on those benefits, higher income seniors will likely continue to do so. Forget about a SALT tax break, too In 2017, the U.S. tax code went through a major revamp that limited the SALT (state and local tax) deduction to $10,000. Under the new bill, the SALT deduction gets a major lift. It rises to $40,000 and is set to increase by 1% per year until 2030, at which point it reverts back to the $10,000 limit. But once again, higher-income seniors lose out. So do younger Americans with large incomes, for that matter. This time around, though, the income thresholds are much higher. Taxpayers with a modified adjusted gross income below $500,000 can qualify. So to be fair, it&#8217;s really only very wealthy seniors (and taxpayers in general) who don&#8217;t get this benefit. The bigger issue really is that the income thresholds for the bonus $6,000 deduction aren&#8217;t as generous as they could be. That&#8217;s going to leave a lot of seniors burdened at a time when costs are up.The post These Seniors Are Left Out of The Big Beautiful Bill&#8217;s Big Tax Break appeared first on 24/7 Wall St..",positive,importante
