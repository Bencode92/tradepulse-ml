"WTV: A Deep-Value ETF With A Broad And Conservative Exposure (Rating Downgrade). WisdomTree U.S. Value Fund (WTV) offers a defensive, value-focused portfolio with a notably low 12.3x forward P/E and broad market-cap exposure. WTV has shifted toward larger, more defensive sectors, underweighting technology and overweighting financials, consumer staples, and energy relative to the Russell 1000.

"TSMC Is Relentlessly Getting Stronger, And The Market Is Mispricing It. TSM is rapidly gaining foundry market share and now has a credible path to high 40s, or even 50%, 5‑year revenue CAGR, helped by Nvidia's incremental H200 demand for China shipments. TSM's 2026 price hikes and better‑than‑expected 2nm yields support a plausible new gross margin plateau above 60% from Q4 FY25 onward. TSM is accelerating its second Arizona fab, with 3nm production now targeted for 2027 instead of 2028, pulling forward advanced‑node US revenue.",positive,importante,CA:WHEAT;LU:FINANCIAL_SERVICES;AU:WHEAT
